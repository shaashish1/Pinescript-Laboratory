// John F Ehlers' Fractal Dimension

// Description:

// Fractal Dimension is a measure of how complicated a self similar 
// shape is. For instance, a line is smaller and more basic than a square.

// The lower the Fractal Dimension the closer a stock chart is to 
// a straight line and therefore the stronger the trend.  
// High readings on the other hand reveal a complex fractal; 
// the shape of a range bound market. 

// These two different market types require very different 
// strategies in order to maximize profits and minimize losses.

//-------------------- Inputs

n = input(20, 'Lag', minval=2)

//-------------------- Logic

half = n/2
HL1  = (highest(high[half], half) - lowest(low[half], half)) / half
HL2  = (highest(high,       half) - lowest(low,       half)) / half
HL   = (highest(high,       n)    - lowest(low,       n))    / n
D    = (log(HL1 + HL2) - log(HL)) / log(2)

dim  = D < 1 ? 1 : D > 2 ? 2 : D
